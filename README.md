# 3D model - Door hook
ðŸ–¨ 3D model of a door hook, includes parametric Fusion 360 file to modify for other types and sizes.

## Summary

My design for an over the door hook, useful for hanging items from the back of the door for storage.

Included are a range of STL files for varying widths of hooks, for a 35mm door and a 25mm hook. A Fusion 360 file is also included where all parameters can be adjusted to make a hook for any situation.
